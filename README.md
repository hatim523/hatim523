### Hi there! 👋

I'm **Hatim**, a backend engineer with over **3 years of experience** in building web applications that don't just scale—they soar! 🚀 I have a passion for writing clean, efficient code, sticking to best practices like **SOLID** principles and keeping things **DRY** (because who likes soggy code, right?). 

I specialize in designing and developing web applications from the ground up, always with an eye on making them scalable, reliable, and as consistent as my morning coffee routine. ☕️

### 🧑‍💻 What I Bring to the Table

While I'm a Django and Python enthusiast, I've had my fair share of fun with:

- **React** (When I feel like living on the edge of JavaScript)
- **Vue.js** (For those who prefer their frameworks like their coffee: lightweight)
- **Moodle (PHP)** (Turning chaos into classrooms, one PHP script at a time!)
